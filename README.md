# OSBanque - Borland Pascal - MS-Dos - 1993

[Cette page en français.](LISEZMOI.md)

With bank data leaks, credit card thefts, phishing scams and regular hacking of merchant and institutional sites, it's highly advisable to keep track of the transactions appearing on our bank accounts. This was already the case 30 years ago, when we wanted to know where we stood and avoid plunging into the infernal cycle of delirious charges levied by banks on overdrawn accounts.

OSBanque was created in 1993 to enable me simply to track transactions on several accounts, with the entry of receipts and payments in “ expenses / income ” mode. Its sole purpose was to simplify my view of my cash flow when I started my professional life and received my first regular income.

It was developed in [Borland Pascal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turbo_Pascal) to run under MS-Dos before the emergence of MS-Windows and personal management tools stuffed with pointless graphics ([Quicken](https://www.quicken.com/about-us/) in first place) published by the leading publishers of business management and accounting solutions for companies.

Nowadays, this software could still be useful, but you'd have to go for a multiplatform version like [this project](https://github.com/DeveloppeurPascal/GestionComptesPersonnels) developed as an example a few years ago, or [its prettier alternative](https://github.com/Serge-Girard/GestionComptesPersonnels) by [Serge Girard](https://github.com/Serge-Girard).

It's possible that this program is compilable with [Free Pascal](https://www.freepascal.org) but I haven't tried. Units not supplied can be found in the [DeveloppeurPascal/librairies-TurboPascal](https://github.com/DeveloppeurPascal/librairies-TurboPascal) repository. If any are missing, please let me know so that I can add them.

You'll find the binarie (8 bits) in the “release” folder. This is the September 19, 1993 version. You can only run it on an MS-Dos emulator, Windows 3.x or 95. There's no point in trying it on Windows beyond these versions.
